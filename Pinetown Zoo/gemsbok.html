                        <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
                            <p>Gemsboks are large antelopes with long, straight horns and distinctive black and white markings. 
                                They are well adapted to arid environments and can be found in the Kalahari Desert and other 
                                parts of southern Africa. Gemsboks are known for their incredible stamina and can run at high 
                                speeds over long distances.</p>

                            <p>All gemsoks have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long 
                                neck and slender legs. Their coat is a striking combination of tan and white, with 
                                bold black markings on the face and legs. Gemsoks are well adapted to their 
                                environment, with a unique ability to regulate their body temperature and conserve 
                                water.</p>
                                <p>Gemsboks are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
                                    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                                <p>You will find the gemsoks at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
